      summary: List my own registration ids
      description: |-
        List attendee registrations that are owned by the current user, provided they are still visible to them.
        
        When a registration is first made, the currently logged in user is recorded in the registration,
        and thus assigned as the 'owner' of the registration. 
        
        - The frontend can use this to determine which registrations to offer for editing to a regular user.
        - The payment service can use this to determine which payment histories should be visible to a regular user.
        
        Even if an admin calls this, they will only receive those registrations that they own.
        An admin can transfer/assign ownership of a registration, for the cases where a registration is sold to a new owner.
        
        Since the user's identity is taken from the JWT representing the currently logged in user, 
        this endpoint cannot be called with an API token. It must be called on behalf of a logged in user.
        
        If you want lists of attendees according to search criteria, have a look at the attendees/find endpoint
        (assuming you have the necessary permissions).
        
        Note that allowing multiple registrations per user id is configuration dependant. If the configuration
        is set to allow only a single registration per user id, this endpoint will always return at most a single
        registration.

      summary: Override the due date for an attendee (but send no email).
      description: |-
        This operation overrides the due date for an attendee, setting it _no earlier_ than the supplied date.
        
        If the unpaid dues transactions for this attendee result in an even later due date, the due date will remain 
        set to that date. Meaning: you can't shorten the dues period with this operation.
        You can only extend it.

        This operation never sends any emails to the attendee! If you need the attendee notified,
        you currently need to use the re-send status notification endpoint.

        Admin only operation.
        
        Note that payment/dues changes will never move the due date _back_ in time so you can use this to extend the time the attendee
        has before they are considered overdue. Effectively, any later changes to dues will honour your request to keep the
        due date _no earlier_ than the supplied date.

        Note that you should never move a due date back in time, unless it's to correct a typo immediately.
        The attendee will have received a payment email that stated the later due date, and may be relying on it.
        To (mostly) prevent this situation, this operation will not let you adjust the due date to a value that is earlier than the
        outstanding transactions of this attendee. Attempting to do so will simply have no effect.

        Note that there may also be situational limitations, such as you cannot check in an attendee unless paid in full.
        These conditions result in a 409 status to distinguish them from situations where the transition is 
        unavailable to the requesting user for permission reasons, which gives a 403.

        at least one of name, email or nickname matches the respective regex, will be put on hold
        for decision by an admin.

Flags can be configured with respect to their visibility and who may change them (admin only, normal user).

With Options, you cannot control the visibility in the configuration, as they are basically options given to the attendee that do not cost money. Use these for "I wish to receive emails about x subject" or "I am a fursuiter" etc.

            Packages are the things that cost money, like being a supersponsor or a day guest for a certain day. They can be
            configured with respect to who may add / remove them, if they are on by default, and whether they are visible if
            not selected (admin only, normal user, completely disabled). There is also configuration as to which packages are
            mutually exclusive, such as sponsor and supersponsor.
            
            If configured with a max_count greater than 1, certain packages may occur multiple times in this list.
            
            Any order of packages is accepted in requests, but in responses the list of packages will always be sorted
            in alphabetical order.
            
            Note: If packages_list is also specified in a request, it takes precedence over this field. In responses,
            both fields will always be present and filled.

        A sorted list of packages as declared in configuration. 
        
        Packages are the things that cost money, like being a supersponsor or a day guest for a certain day. They can be
        configured with respect to who may add / remove them, if they are on by default, and whether they are visible if
        not selected (admin only, normal user, completely disabled). There is also configuration as to which packages are mutually exclusive, such as sponsor and supersponsor.
        
        It is an error to specify a package multiple times in the list. Requests need not sort the package list by name,
        but responses sent by this service always have the package list sorted by package name.
        
        The count field can be left unspecified when sending this data structure, that means a count of 1, but it will always be present
        and filled in responses sent by this service.
      example:
        - name: attendance
          count: 1
        - name: room-none
          count: 1
        - name: sponsor

            A comma separated list of admin-only flags as declared in configuration, but only those that are not even _visible_ to a normal user. This is a separate field in order to avoid having resources change depending on your permissions, as that may lead to strange behaviour.  
            
            Flags are used to store yes/no-style information about an attendee, and displayed as checkboxes. Flags can be configured with respect to their visibility and who may change them (admin only, normal user). Flags are used to represent properties of the attendee, such as "is staff", "does not wish their name to appear in the convention booklet", etc.
